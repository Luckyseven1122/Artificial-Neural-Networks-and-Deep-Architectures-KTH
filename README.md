# Artificial Neural Networks-and-Deep-Architectures (KTH DD2437)

**Author:**

I am Álvaro Orgaz Expósito, a data science student at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden) and a statistician from UPC-UB (Barcelona, Spain).

**Abstract:**

This repository contains the assignments (code + report) of the ANN and Deep Architectures course in my master's degree in Data Science at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden).

- *Assignment 1*: Learning and generalisation in feed-forward networks from perceptron learning to backpropagation.

- *Assignment 2*: Radial basis functions (RBF), competitive learning and self-organised maps (SOM).

- *Assignment 3*: Hopfield networks.

- *Assignment 4*: Deep neural network architectures with autoencoders using Keras (applied to MNIST images dataset).

**Code:**

The project has been developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
